First impression

As soon as you import the package you should get an icon next to any sprites in your scene.
The icon is made up of 2 components. The image and the number on the right hand side. 
The icon represents the rendering layer name, whereas the number denotes the sprite order in this layer.
You can click on this icon to select all sprites in this layer.

Customizing icons and font colour

Each of the above can be customized through an editor window that you can open by clicking 'Window' > 'Rendering highlighters customizer'
This editor window shows all of your layers.  You can change the texture to represent the layer, the text colour to be used for the order in the layer.
If you click on the layer name, you will select all sprites on that layer in the current scene.
Icons size should be 50 * 15 of type TIF.
There is a template icon with size 500 * 150 for easy modification.  Scale this down to 10% before using it in the project.

Adding/Removing layers
Whenever you add a new layer, go to the editor window by clicking 'Window' > 'Rendering highlighters customizer'
Click on 'Resync layers'

VFX Support
The Shuriken particle system does not expose the Rendering layer and order by default. By adding the 'VFXSorter' script, you'll expose the 
rendering layer and sorting order properties for this type of renderer. These can be modified directly in the editor.
